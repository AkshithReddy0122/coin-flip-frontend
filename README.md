# Crypto Coinflip Game

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based coinflip game that allows users to connect their blockchain wallet, select a blockchain, and participate in a coinflip game. Users can risk tokens from supported blockchains and potentially double their tokens based on the outcome of the coinflip.

### Key Features

- **Blockchain Selection**: Users can choose from Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, or Bitcoin.
- **Token Wagering**: Users can select the amount of tokens they wish to risk.
- **Coinflip Mechanics**: The coinflip will determine if the user wins or loses their wager.
- **Token Balance Display**: Users can view their updated token balance directly in the game interface.
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect your wallet to interact with the blockchain.
